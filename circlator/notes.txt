Hi folks

Here is the script to find the dnaA/other break points in contigs. 

Give it two fasta files: one with assembly and the other with genes of your choice. It will reorganise (and optionally rename) the contigs and print  a summary. You can get it to run prodigal if you wish. It will also detect genes that are in the wrong orientation and reverse complement the sequence accordingly.

Still in my directory until installation. Please let me know of any bugs and improvements. Naming software is not my forte - please feel free to suggest.

I have a file with a collection of dnaA sequences if you need it:
/lustre/scratch108/pathogen/nds/PACBIO_assembly/universal_dnaA/all_dnaA.fa

/lustre/scratch108/pathogen/nds/Git_projects/bio_assembly_refinement/scripts/contig_break_finder -h

usage: contig_break_finder [options]

Find a break point in the contig to be the new start

positional arguments:
  Input fasta file      Input fasta file
  Gene sequences        Fasta file with dnaA/refA/refB or other sequences

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --hit_percent_id INT  Minimum acceptable hit percent id [80]
  --min_hit_length INT  Minimum acceptable hit length expressed as percentage
                        of gene length [100]
  --no_random_gene      Will only look for genes given
  --no_rename           Do not rename contigs to indicate chromosome/plasmid
  --debug               Keep all temp files


Sample usage from modules:
from bio_assembly_refinement import contig_break_finder 
â€¦
break_finder = contig_break_finder.ContigBreakFinder(fasta_file = test_fasta_file,
                                                    gene_file = test_dnaA_file                                    
                                                    )   
break_finder.run()
